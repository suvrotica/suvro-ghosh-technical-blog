![DICE and SCOPE](/assets/images/dice.jpeg)

One acronym for the types of statistics: Descriptive, Inferential, Computational, and Exploratory.

When I roll the ![dice](/assets/images/dice.jpeg), I hope to get a six.<img src="/assets/blog/casual-life-3d-girl-boy-poses.webp" alt="Not so wide" style="float: left" />

for Descriptive: Descriptive statistics is like a "Director" of a movie. It provides a detailed "description" of what's happening in the data, just like a director presents a detailed view of a story. It involves measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), and graphical representations (bar charts, histograms, pie charts).

# I üîç

for Inferential: Inferential statistics is like an "Investigator". It goes beyond the immediate data to make inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample, just like Sherlock Holmes, and makes deductions based on clues. It involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.

Machine Learning, can be considered a part of Inferential statistics. Machine Learning uses algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something. So, in a way, it's "inferring" patterns based on the data it has been trained on.

# C üñ•

for Computational: Computational statistics, or statistical computing, involves the design and analysis of algorithms for solving statistical problems. It's like a "Computer" that uses computational power to perform complex calculations and simulations.

# E üß≠

for Exploratory: Exploratory data analysis is like an "Explorer". It's a way of visualizing, summarizing, and interpreting the information that's in the data. It's an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, with visual methods. Complements D.
