The head of pre-modern legal and map collections at the National Archives, discusses the Domesday Book, the earliest public record held within the Exchequer collection at the National Archives. The Domesday Book is a record of lands, landholding, and resources in medieval England. It was never just a single book; originally, there were two Domesday books - Great Domesday and Little Domesday. The Domesday Book was written in medieval Latin and contains around two million words.
